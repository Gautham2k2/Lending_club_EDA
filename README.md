**Lending Club Loan Data Analysis**

**Overview:** 
This repository contains the code and documentation for my data analysis project on the Lending Club Loan Data. In this project, I utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is the publicly available Lending Club Loan Data. It includes various attributes of loans issued through the Lending Club platform, such as loan amount, interest rate, term, loan status, and more. The target variable/column for analysis is the "loan_status" column, which indicates the current status of the loan.

**Dependencies:**
To run the code in this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

**Results:**
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the Lending Club Loan Data. Key findings include:

Distribution of loan amounts and interest rates.
Relationship between loan status and other attributes.
Identification of factors influencing loan default rates.
